	abstract = {Up to now, there has only been little work on using features from temporal approximations of signals for audio recognition. Time-frequency tradeoffs are an important issue in signal processing; sparse representations using overcomplete dictionaries may (or may not, depending on the dictionary) have more time-frequency flexibility than standard short-time Fourier transform. Also, the precise temporal structure of signals cannot be captured by spectral-based feature methods. Here, we present a biologically inspired three-step process for audio classification: 1) Efficient atomic functions are learned in an unsupervised manner on mixtures of percussion sounds (drum phrases), optimizing the length as well as the shape of the atoms. 2) An analog spike model is used to sparsely approximate percussion sound signals (bass drum, snare drum, hi-hat). The spike model consists of temporally shifted versions of the learned atomic functions, each having a precise temporal position and amplitude. To obtain the decomposition given a set of atomic functions, matching pursuit is used. 3) Features are extracted from the resulting spike representation of the signal. The classification accuracy of our method using a support vector machine ({SVM)} in a 3-class database transfer task is 87.8\%. Using gammatone functions instead of the learned sparse functions yields an even better classification rate of 97.6\%. Testing the features on sounds containing additive white Gaussian noise reveals that sparse approximation features are far more robust to such distortions than our benchmark feature set of timbre descriptor ({TD)} features.},

If this is appropriate for polyphonic music signals, specific approaches are needed for systems dealing with percussive audio signals such as those produced by drums, tabla or djembe.

In this paper, we propose several methods for drum loop transcription where the drums signals dataset reflects the variability encountered in modern audio recordings (real and natural drum kits, audio effects, simultaneous instruments, etc.).

abstract = {An unsupervised learning algorithm for the separation of sound sources in one-channel music signals is presented. The algorithm is based on factorizing the magnitude spectrogram of an input signal into a sum of components, each of which has a fixed magnitude spectrum and a time-varying gain. Each sound source, in turn, is modeled as a sum of one or more components. The parameters of the components are estimated by minimizing the reconstruction error between the input spectrogram and the model, while restricting the component spectrograms to be nonnegative and favoring components whose gains are slowly varying and sparse. Temporal continuity is favored by using a cost term which is the sum of squared differences between the gains in adjacent frames, and sparseness is favored by penalizing nonzero gains. The proposed iterative estimation algorithm is initialized with random values, and the gains and the spectra are then alternatively updated using multiplicative update rules until the values converge. Simulation experiments were carried out using generated mixtures of pitched musical instrument samples and drum sounds. The performance of the proposed method was compared with independent subspace analysis and basic nonnegative matrix factorization, which are based on the same linear model. According to these simulations, the proposed method enables a better separation quality than the previous algorithms. Especially, the temporal continuity criterion improved the detection of pitched musical sounds. The sparseness criterion did not produce significant improvements},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to multipitch analysis by utilizing the Harmonic Nonnegative Matrix Approximation, a harmonically-constrained and penalized version of the Nonnegative Matrix Approximation (NNMA) method. It also includes a description of a note onset, offset and amplitude retrieval procedure based on that technique. Compared with the previous NNMA approaches, specific initialization of the basis matrix is employed – the basis matrix is initialized with zeros everywhere but at positions corresponding to harmonic frequencies of consequent notes of the equal temperament scale. This results in the basis containing nothing but harmonically structured vectors, even after the learning process, and the activity matrix’s rows containing peaks corresponding to note onset times and amplitudes. Furthermore, additional penalties of mutual uncorrelation and sparseness of rows are placed upon the activity matrix. The proposed method is able to uncover the underlying musical structure better than the previous NNMA approaches and makes the note detection process very straightforward.},
