@inproceedings{Gillet2006,
abstract = {One of the main bottlenecks in the progress of the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) research field is the limited ac- cess to common, large and annotated audio databases that could serve for technology development and/or evaluation. The aim of this paper is to present in detail the ENST-Drums database, emphasizing on both the content and the recording process. This audiovisual database of drum performances by three professional drummers was recorded on 8 audio channels and 2 video channels. The drum sequences are fully annotated and will be, for a large part, freely distributed for research purposes. The large variety in its content should serve research in various domains of audio signal process- ing involving drums, ranging from single drum event clas- sification to complex multimodal drum track transcription and extraction from polyphonic music.},

@inproceedings{Roebel2015,
abstract = {This paper presents an investigation into the detection and classifica-tion of drum sounds in polyphonic music and drum loops using non-negative matrix deconvolution (NMD) and the Itakura Saito diver-gence. The Itakura Saito divergence has recently been proposed as especially appropriate for decomposing audio spectra due to the fact that it is scale invariant, but it has not yet been widely adopted. The article studies new contributions for audio event detection methods using the Itakura Saito divergence that improve efficiency and nu-merical stability, and simplify the generation of target pattern sets. A new approach for handling background sounds is proposed and moreover, a new detection criteria based on estimating the percep-tual presence of the target class sources is introduced. Experimental results obtained for drum detection in polyphonic music and drum soli demonstrate the beneficial effects of the proposed extensions.},
